            <h5>Frontend Web-Developer</h5>
            <p>
                I'm Lukas, a Junior level Web Developer with a strong focus on frontend design, residing near Vienna, Austria. I find immense joy and pride in taking an idea from conception to a fully realized webpage or application, all while continuously learning and growing along the way.
                <br><br>
                My passion for software development stems from my commitment to delivering my best work and improving with each project. In my spare time, I love cooking (eating as well), sharing laughs with my mom while poking fun at interior design mishaps on television, and rescuing my plants from the brink of dehydrationâ€”sometimes I get so engrossed in perfecting that div layout that I forget to water them.
